# hexSMLFM
This 3D reconstruction code accompanies the preprint titled "High-density volumetric super-resolution microscopy" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.02.539032v1). 
Localisation data collected using a (square or hexagonal) fourier light field microscope should be localised in 2D before using hexSMLFM to calculate the 3D coordinates.
The code hosted here on GitHub is actively maintained by the authors of the preprint and is freely available for download and use. Please get in touch if you encounter any difficulties.
